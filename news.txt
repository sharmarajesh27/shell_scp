The tickets for the 2023 ODI World Cup, to be played across India, will
 finally go on sale on August 25, just over 40 days before the first game
 of the tournament on October 5. The update came from the ICC soon after 
the revised schedule for the World Cup - also much delayed - was released,
 with dates changed for nine games including the big-ticket India vs Pakistan fixture.

The tickets for all matches not featuring India - in the warm-ups and in the to
urnament - will go on sale first, on August 25. Following that, there will be a
 six-phase sale of tickets for games featuring India, the first for their two 
warm-up games (vs England in Guwahati on September 30 and vs Netherlands/Sri Lanka 
in Thiruvananthapuram on October 3) and then for their games in the main event.
